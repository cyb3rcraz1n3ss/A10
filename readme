cookies are yummy 

Cookies are small text files of data that are stored on your computer when you visit a website. They contain information like what computer you have, what browser you are using,
the time, date, location, IP address, timezone, your username and many identifiers used for tracking. When the user visits the website again in the future the web server checks your
cookies to see if you ever visited the same website and can say things like welcome back Donald. 

I think this process should be eliminated and websites should always have a default look and feel. No one should be tracking your movements across websites and viewing location
data and other sites visited are a huge privacy concern. This content is only for the user to see and no one else. 

Ethical by definition, no the use of cookies is unethical because there not only being used for the website to load, instead they are being used to track peoples movements online.
